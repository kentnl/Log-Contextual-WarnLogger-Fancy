- Initial Release.
- QA Tests and travis integration still missing, mostly
  because I can't be bothered dealing with the complexity mountain
  that is DZil anymore, and I need to re-engineer all my travis
  stuff to deal with DZil changes and it all has to stop.
- So just report bugs when you find them, thanks.
